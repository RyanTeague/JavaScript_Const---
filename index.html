    <!--JavaScript Const
    
        The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

        Variables defined with const have Block Scope 
    -->

    <!--Connot be Reassigned
    
        A variable defined with the const keyword cannot be reassigned:
    -->
    <h2>JavaScript const</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    try {
      const PI = 3.141592653589793;
      PI = 3.14;
    }
    catch (err) {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
    }
    </script>
    <hr>

    <!--Must be Assigned
    
        JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are 
        declared:
        correct
        cont PI = 3.14159265359;

        incorrect
        const PI;
        PI = 3.14159265359;
    -->

    <!--When to use JavaScript const?
    
        Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

        Use const when you declare:

            A new Array
            A new Object
            A new Function
            A new RegExp
    -->

    <!--Constant Objeccts and Arrays
    
    The keyword const is a little misleading.

        It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

        Because of this you can NOT:

            Reassign a constant value
            Reassign a constant array
            Reassign a constant object
            But you CAN:

        Change the elements of constant array
        Change the properties of constant object        
    -->

    <!--Constant Arrays
    
        You can change the elements of a constant array
    -->

    <h2>JavaScript const</h2>

    <p>Declaring a constant array does NOT make the elements unchangeable:</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    // Create an Array:
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    
    // Change an element:
    cars[0] = "Toyota";
    
    // Add an element:
    cars.push("Audi");
    
    // Display the Array:
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars; 
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--But you can NOT reassign the arry:-->
    <h2>JavaScript const</h2>

    <p>You can NOT reassign a constant array:</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    try {
      const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];
    }
    catch (err) {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
    }
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--Constatnt Objects
    
        You can change the porperties of a constatnt object:
    -->

    <!--incorrect example-->
    <h2>JavaScript const</h2>

    <p>You can NOT reassign a constant object:</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    try {
      const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
      car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"};
    }

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;

    <!--Difference Betwwen var, let and const
    
        	Scope	Redeclare	Reassign	Hoisted	Binds this
var	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
let	Yes	No	Yes	No	No
const	Yes	No	No	No	No
What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this.

Browser Support
The let and const keywords are not supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.
    -->

    <!--Block Scope
    
        Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.

        The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block:

    -->

    <h2>JavaScropt const variables has block scope</h2>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
    const  x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

    {  
    const x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
    }

    // Here x is 10
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "x is " + x;
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--Redeclaring
    
        Redeclaring a JavaScript var variable is allowed anywhere in a program:

Example
var x = 2;     // Allowed
var x = 3;     // Allowed
x = 4;         // Allowed
Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
var x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed

{
let x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}

{
const x = 2;   // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
const x = 2;     // Allowed
x = 2;           // Not allowed
var x = 2;       // Not allowed
let x = 2;       // Not allowed
const x = 2;     // Not allowed

{
  const x = 2;   // Allowed
  x = 2;         // Not allowed
  var x = 2;     // Not allowed
  let x = 2;     // Not allowed
  const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:

Example
const x = 2;       // Allowed

{
  const x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
  const x = 4;   // Allowed
}
    -->

    <!--Hoisting
    
        Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

        Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

        Example 
        This is OK:
    -->
    <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

    <p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    carName = "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    var carName;
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

        Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.

        Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:
    -->

        <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
        <p>With <b>const</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared:</p>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        
        <script>
        
        try {
          alert(carName);
          const carName = "Volvo";
        }
        catch (err) {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
